      <h2>About Me</h2>
    </header>
    <p>Hi, I’m Irem — a 3rd-year Computational Engineering student with a minor in Computer Science at Aalto University. I am passionate about machine learning, robotics, and building solutions that bridge technology and human impact. My academic coursework combines Machine Learning, C++, and Data Structures with hands-on engineering experience, from designing competition-winning robots at VEX Robotics to optimizing material models using Machine Learning and CPFEM simulations. Beyond the lab, I thrive on leadership: co-founding UniPath to guide students abroad, organizing multiple TEDx events, and being named a finalist for EY NextGen Women for my strategic thinking. I'm currently writing my thesis on "AI-driven Transformation in Structural Engineering" and will be starting my master's degree in September 2025 on Machine Learning, Data Science, and Artificial Intelligence at Aalto University.</p>

        <h3>Mahjong Game (C++ / Qt Project)</h3>
        <div class="project-details">
          <p>This was my final project for the Object-Oriented Programming course, where I developed a fully functional <em>Mahjong Solitaire</em> game. The project combines a C++ backend with a QML-based frontend using the Qt framework. The user can select and match open tile pairs while the game ensures rules are enforced (e.g., tiles that are not open cannot be selected). The game board uses a “turtle layout” similar to traditional Mahjong Solitaire.</p>
          <p><strong>Key Features:</strong><br>
          - Functional 2D graphical interface built with QML<br>
          - Logic and model-view separation implemented in modern C++<br>
          - Tile interactions handled through QML bindings to C++ objects<br>
          - Dynamic layout generation (Turtle Layout)<br>
          - Bonus: Board shuffle option to assist when no moves remain</p>
          <p><strong>What I Did:</strong><br>
          - Designed the architecture using Qt’s object model, exposing C++ classes (<code>Board</code>, <code>Tile</code>, <code>TileModel</code>) to QML<br>
          - Managed game state, tile selection logic, and match validation entirely in C++<br>
          - Utilized QML to create an intuitive user interface with responsive tile interactions<br>
          - Implemented layout generation and optional reshuffle logic on the backend<br>
          - Integrated assets using Qt Resource System for portability</p>
          <p><strong>What I Learned:</strong><br>
          - How to build desktop applications by combining declarative UI (QML) with imperative logic (C++)<br>
          - How to use model-view separation and context properties in Qt<br>
          - Advanced object-oriented programming practices, including encapsulation, abstraction, and modular design<br>
          - The fundamentals of memory management, meta-object programming, and QML-C++ communication</p>

        <h3>Optimization of CPFEM Parameters using ML</h3>
        <div class="project-details">
          <p>This research project focused on using machine learning (ML) to optimize parameter calibration in Crystal Plasticity Finite Element Models (CPFEM) for advanced steels. The study aimed to automate the traditionally manual and time-consuming process of calibrating material parameters from nanoindentation data using an ANN model trained on simulation results. My primary contribution was leading the development of the machine learning pipeline and all data engineering steps required for precise predictions.</p>
          <p><strong>Key Features:</strong><br>
          - Worked with dual-phase steels (DP1000 and QP1200) using nanoindentation data<br>
          - Designed data cleaning and preprocessing pipeline (IQR filtering, normalization)<br>
          - Developed feature engineering steps for optimal model training<br>
          - Trained and evaluated multiple ML models: ANN, CNN, LSTM, and Random Forest<br>
          - Achieved high-accuracy calibration with low RMSE and high R² scores (up to 0.99)</p>
          <p><strong>What I Did:</strong><br>
          - Designed and coded the complete ML pipeline in Python, including data preprocessing, training/testing, and evaluation<br>
          - Created custom loss functions and model evaluation routines<br>
          - Developed a robust ANN-based system that predicted critical CPFEM parameters (shear stress, hardening rates, etc.) from nanoindentation FD curves<br>
          - Integrated percentile-based outputs (25th, 50th, 75th) into model training for improved curve-fitting fidelity</p>
          <p><strong>What I Learned:</strong><br>
          - Gained deep hands-on experience in real-world application of machine learning to materials engineering<br>
          - Learned to handle scientific datasets, reduce noise, and optimize model performance<br>
          - Improved teamwork and interdisciplinary collaboration across engineering, simulation, and data science domains<br>
          - Developed a greater understanding of predictive modeling, CPFEM workflows, and materials informatics</p>

        <h3>PostgreSQL Volunteer Management Platform (Databases Course Project)</h3>
        <div class="project-details">
          <p>This project was part of a Databases and Algorithms course where we were tasked with designing and implementing a relational database from scratch to manage a volunteer matching system. The goal was to develop a comprehensive backend that could match volunteers with requests based on skills, availability, and interests, while also being able to track, analyze, and visualize application statistics.</p>
          <p><strong>Key Features:</strong><br>
          - Built an entire PostgreSQL schema including entities like Volunteer, Skill, Request, Application, etc.<br>
          - Designed and normalized ER schema; implemented constraints and relationships<br>
          - Loaded real datasets (Excel format) into the database using SQLAlchemy<br>
          - Wrote complex SQL queries for matching logic and monthly statistics (requests vs applications)<br>
          - Built visualizations of application volume, skill match success, and trends using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn</p>
          <p><strong>What I Did:</strong><br>
          - Developed the full data ETL pipeline using Python: loading, cleaning, formatting, and storing structured data into PostgreSQL<br>
          - Wrote modular SQL query handlers and Python functions for creating and analyzing tables<br>
          - Created custom analysis scripts to assess volunteer skill correlation with successful applications<br>
          - Built monthly visual breakdowns of request vs application volumes using CTEs and aggregations</p>

        <h3>Beijing Air Quality Prediction (ML Course Project)</h3>
        <div class="project-details">
          <p>This machine learning course project involved building a predictive model for Beijing's Air Quality Index (AQI) using historical environmental and pollutant data. The goal was to create a regression model that could accurately forecast daily AQI values based on variables like PM2.5, temperature, humidity, and wind speed.</p>
          <p><strong>Key Features:</strong><br>
          - Dataset sourced from UCI (Beijing PM2.5, 2010–2014), processed into daily aggregates<br>
          - Used two regression models: Random Forest Regressor and Ridge Regression<br>
          - Preprocessing included handling missing data and Min-Max normalization<br>
          - Evaluated models using Mean Squared Error (MSE) on train, validation, and test sets<br>
          - Performed visual data analysis, including feature distributions and correlation matrix</p>
          <p><strong>What I Did:</strong><br>
          - Cleaned and preprocessed over 8,000 daily observations from the original hourly dataset<br>
          - Trained and evaluated both ML models using a 75/10/15 data split<br>
          - Applied Ridge Regression to mitigate overfitting and achieve lower MSE<br>
          - Analyzed model performance using MSE metrics and selected Ridge Regression as the final model<br>
